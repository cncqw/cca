## 6.1 Few-shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting is the inclusion of 2–4 input/output examples in a prompt to demonstrate the expected behavior.

**Why few-shot is more effective than textual descriptions:**
- A vague instruction like “be more precise” can be interpreted in many ways
- An example unambiguously shows the expected format and decision logic
- The model generalizes the pattern to new cases (it does not just repeat the examples)

**Types of few-shot examples and when to use them:**

1. **Examples for ambiguous scenarios:**

```
Request: "My order is broken"
Action: Call get_customer -> lookup_order -> check status.
Rationale: “broken” may mean a damaged item; you need order details.

Request: "Get me a manager"
Action: Immediately call escalate_to_human.
Rationale: The customer explicitly requests a human. Do not attempt to solve autonomously.
```

2. **Examples for output formatting:**

```
Finding example:
{
  "location": "src/auth/login.ts:42",
  "issue": "SQL injection in the username parameter",
  "severity": "critical",
  "suggested_fix": "Use a parameterized query"
}
```

3. **Examples to separate acceptable vs problematic code:**

```
// Acceptable (do not flag):
const items = data.filter(x => x.active);

// Problem (flag):
const items = data.filter(x => x.active == true); // Use strict equality ===
```

4. **Examples for extraction from different document formats:**

```
Document with inline citations:
"As shown in the study (Smith, 2023), the rate is 42%."
-> {"value": "42%", "source": "Smith, 2023", "type": "inline_citation"}

Document with bibliography references:
"The rate is 42%. [1]"
-> {"value": "42%", "source": "reference_1", "type": "bibliography"}
```

5. **Examples for informal measurements:**

```
Text: "about two handfuls of rice"
-> {"amount": "~100g", "original_text": "two handfuls", "precision": "approximate"}

Text: "a pinch of salt"
-> {"amount": "~1g", "original_text": "a pinch", "precision": "approximate"}
```

Few-shot is especially effective for extracting informal and non-standard measurement units that are too diverse for purely rule-based instructions.

**Format normalization rules in prompts:**
When using strict JSON schemas for structured output, add normalization rules in the prompt:

```
Normalization:
- Dates: always ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD); "yesterday" -> compute an absolute date
- Currency: numeric amount + currency code; "five bucks" -> {"amount": 5, "currency": "USD"}
- Percentages: decimal fraction; "half" -> 0.5
```

This prevents semantic errors where the JSON is syntactically valid but values are inconsistent.

## 6.2 Explicit Criteria vs Vague Instructions

**Bad (vague):**

```
Check code comments for accuracy.
Be conservative—report only high-confidence findings.
```

**Good (explicit criteria):**

```
Flag a comment as problematic ONLY if:
1. The comment describes behavior that CONTRADICTS the actual code behavior
2. The comment references a non-existent function or variable
3. A TODO/FIXME comment refers to a bug that has already been fixed in code

Do NOT flag:
- Comments that are merely stylistically outdated
- Comments with minor wording inaccuracies
- Missing comments (that is a separate category)
```

**Define severity criteria with examples:**

```
CRITICAL: Runtime failure for users
  Example: NullPointerException while processing a payment

HIGH: Security vulnerability
  Example: SQL injection, XSS, missing authorization checks

MEDIUM: Logic bug without immediate impact
  Example: Wrong sorting, off-by-one error

LOW: Code quality
  Example: Duplication, suboptimal algorithm for small data
```

## 6.3 Prompt Chaining

Prompt chaining breaks a complex task into a sequence of focused steps:

```
Step 1: Analyze auth.ts (local issues only)
       -> Output: list of issues in auth.ts

Step 2: Analyze database.ts (local issues only)
       -> Output: list of issues in database.ts

Step 3: Integration pass (cross-file dependencies)
       -> Output: issues at module boundaries
```

**Why this matters:**
- Avoids **attention dilution**—when the model receives too many files at once, it may miss bugs in some files while providing shallow commentary on others
- Ensures consistent analysis quality per file
- Allows separate analysis of cross-file interactions

**When to use prompt chaining vs dynamic decomposition:**
- **Prompt chaining** — predictable, repeatable tasks (code review, file migrations)
- **Dynamic decomposition** — open-ended investigations where subtasks become clear only during execution

## 6.4 The “Interview” Pattern

Before implementing a solution, Claude asks clarifying questions:

```
Claude: "Before implementing caching for the API, a few questions:
1. Which cache invalidation strategy do you prefer—TTL or event-based?
2. Is stale data acceptable when the cache is unavailable?
3. Should caching be per-user or global?
4. What is the expected data volume to cache?"
```

**When this is useful:**
- Unfamiliar domain (fintech, healthcare, legal systems)
- Tasks with non-obvious implications (cache strategies, failure modes)
- Multiple viable approaches where the best choice depends on context

## 6.5 Validation and Retry-with-Feedback

When extracted data fails validation:

```
Step 1: Extract data from the document
Step 2: Validate (Pydantic, JSON Schema, business rules)
Step 3: If there's an error—retry with context:
  - The original document
  - The previous (incorrect) extraction
  - The specific error: "Field 'total' = 150, but sum(line_items) = 145. Re-check values."
```

**When retry will be effective:**
- Format errors (date in the wrong format)
- Structural errors (a field placed in the wrong location)
- Arithmetic inconsistencies (the model can re-check)

**When retry will NOT help:**
- The information is absent from the source document
- The required context is external (the data is in another document not provided)

**Pydantic as a validation tool:**
Pydantic is a Python library for schema-based data validation. For the exam, the key points are:
- **Structural validation:** types, requiredness, enum constraints checked in code after receiving JSON from Claude
- **Semantic validation:** custom validators enforce business logic (sum of items equals total; start_date < end_date)
- **Validate–retry loops:** on Pydantic validation failure, construct an error message and re-prompt Claude with the error context
- **JSON Schema generation:** Pydantic models can generate JSON Schema for `tool_use`, providing a single source of truth

## 6.6 Self-correction

A pattern for detecting internal contradictions:

```json
{
  "stated_total": "$150.00",
  "calculated_total": "$145.00",
  "conflict_detected": true,
  "line_items": [
    {"name": "Widget A", "price": 75.00},
    {"name": "Widget B", "price": 70.00}
  ]
}
```

The model extracts both the stated value and a computed value—if they differ, `conflict_detected` allows you to handle the discrepancy.
