# Domain 2: Tool Design and MCP Integration (18%)

## 2.1 Designing Tool Interfaces with Clear Descriptions

### Key knowledge:
- Tool descriptions are the **primary mechanism** an LLM uses to select tools; minimal descriptions lead to unreliable selection
- The importance of including input formats, example queries, edge cases, and applicability boundaries
- Ambiguous or overlapping descriptions cause misrouting
- System prompt wording can create unintended associations with tools

### Key skills:
- Write descriptions that clearly distinguish each tool from similar alternatives
- Rename tools to eliminate functional overlap (e.g., `analyze_content` -> `extract_web_results`)
- Split general-purpose tools into specialized ones with clear input/output contracts

## 2.2 Implementing Structured Error Responses for MCP Tools

### Key knowledge:
- The `isError` flag in MCP tool responses
- The difference between **transient errors** (timeouts), **validation errors** (bad input), **business errors** (policy violations), and **access/permission errors**
- Generic errors ("Operation failed") prevent correct recovery decisions
- The difference between retryable and non-retryable errors

### Key skills:
- Return structured metadata such as `errorCategory` (transient/validation/permission), `isRetryable`, and a human-readable message
- Use `retryable: false` for business-rule violations with clear user-facing explanations
- Do local recovery inside subagents for transient failures; propagate only errors they cannot resolve
- Distinguish access failures (retry decision) from valid empty results (no matches)

## 2.3 Allocating Tools Across Agents and Configuring `tool_choice`

### Key knowledge:
- Too many tools per agent (e.g., 18 instead of 4–5) **reduces** tool selection reliability
- Agents with tools outside their specialization tend to misuse them
- Scoped tool access: only role-relevant tools plus a limited set of cross-role utilities
- `tool_choice`: `"auto"`, `"any"`, and forced tool selection (`{"type": "tool", "name": "..."}`)

### Key skills:
- Restrict each subagent’s toolset to what is relevant for its role
- Replace general tools with constrained alternatives (e.g., `fetch_url` -> `load_document`)
- Use `tool_choice: "any"` to guarantee a tool call instead of a text answer
- Force a specific tool to ensure execution order

## 2.4 Integrating MCP Servers into Claude Code and Agent Workflows

### Key knowledge:
- MCP server scope: project (`.mcp.json`) for teams vs user (`~/.claude.json`) for experiments
- Environment variable substitution in `.mcp.json` (e.g., `${GITHUB_TOKEN}`) for secret management
- Tools from all connected MCP servers are discovered on connection and are available simultaneously
- MCP resources as “content catalogs” (task summaries, database schemas) to reduce exploratory tool calls

### Key skills:
- Configure shared MCP servers in project `.mcp.json` with env-var-based tokens
- Keep personal/experimental servers in `~/.claude.json`
- Prefer community MCP servers over custom servers for standard integrations

## 2.5 Selecting and Applying Built-in Tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob)

### Key knowledge:
- **Grep**: search within file contents (function names, error messages, imports)
- **Glob**: find files by name/extension patterns
- **Read/Write**: full-file operations; **Edit**: precise changes via unique text matches
- If Edit fails due to non-unique matches, fall back to Read + Write

### Key skills:
- Use Grep for content search and Glob for file discovery by patterns
- Build understanding incrementally: Grep entry points, then Read to trace flows
- Trace function usage through wrapper modules
