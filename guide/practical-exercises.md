# Practical Exercises

## Exercise 1: Multi-tool Agent with Escalation Logic

**Goal:** Design an agent loop with tool integration, structured error handling, and escalation.

**Steps:**
1. Define 3–4 MCP tools with detailed descriptions (include two similar tools to test tool selection)
2. Implement an agent loop checking `stop_reason` (`"tool_use"` / `"end_turn"`)
3. Add structured error responses: `errorCategory`, `isRetryable`, description
4. Implement an interceptor hook that blocks operations above a threshold and routes to escalation
5. Test with multi-aspect requests

**Domains:** 1 (Agent architecture), 2 (Tools and MCP), 5 (Context and reliability)

## Exercise 2: Configuring Claude Code for Team Development

**Goal:** Configure CLAUDE.md, custom commands, path-specific rules, and MCP servers.

**Steps:**
1. Create a project-level CLAUDE.md with universal standards
2. Create `.claude/rules/` files with YAML frontmatter for different code areas (`paths: ["src/api/**/*"]`, `paths: ["**/*.test.*"]`)
3. Create a project skill under `.claude/skills/` with `context: fork` and `allowed-tools`
4. Configure an MCP server in `.mcp.json` with environment variables + a personal override in `~/.claude.json`
5. Test planning mode vs direct execution on tasks of different complexity

**Domains:** 3 (Claude Code configuration), 2 (Tools and MCP)

## Exercise 3: Structured Data Extraction Pipeline

**Goal:** JSON schemas, `tool_use` for structured output, validation/retry loops, batch processing.

**Steps:**
1. Define an extraction tool with a JSON schema (required/optional fields, enums with "other", nullable fields)
2. Build a validation loop: on error, retry with the document, the incorrect extraction, and the specific validation error
3. Add few-shot examples for documents with different structures
4. Use batch processing via the Message Batches API: 100 documents, handle failures via `custom_id`
5. Route to humans: field-level confidence scores, document-type analysis

**Domains:** 4 (Prompt engineering), 5 (Context and reliability)

## Exercise 4: Designing and Debugging a Multi-agent Research Pipeline

**Goal:** Subagent orchestration, context passing, error propagation, synthesis with source tracking.

**Steps:**
1. A coordinator with 2+ subagents (`allowedTools` includes `"Task"`, context is passed explicitly in prompts)
2. Run subagents in parallel via multiple `Task` calls in a single response
3. Require structured subagent output: claim, quote, source URL, publication date
4. Simulate a subagent timeout: return structured error context to the coordinator and continue with partial results
5. Test with conflicting data: preserve both values with attribution; separate confirmed vs disputed findings

**Domains:** 1 (Agent architecture), 2 (Tools and MCP), 5 (Context and reliability)
